# Welcome !

The  GSI Cloud Native Enablement is self-paced learning journey that has been crafted to enable partner teams to get up to speed with learning how to build solutions with IBM Cloud,Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Cloud Paks. Each section of learning includes mutliple hours of hands-on enablement activities. These are performed inside a fully enabled IBM Cloud Account containing all the Cloud Services you need to achieve success. 

In order to complete the enablement activities, you must have access received an **IBM GSI Sandbox** invite email. A **IBM GSI Sandbox** includes a full managed instance of OpenShift and the corresponding **IBM Cloud Paks**, the cluster is also enabled with the accelerator asset from the [**IBM Garage for Cloud**](https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/). The asset rapidly increases your time to success when developing cloud native application with IBM Cloud and RedHat OpenShift. 

## Goal

> Ensure that GSI Ecosystem Partners are fully enabled 
> to support their client engagements and  co-creating 
> solutions based on Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Cloud Paks 
> that run on the IBM Cloud.
> <cite>IBM GSI Ecosystem Team</cite>

How we will get there:
- Recordings from IBM Cloud SME
- Digital self-paced enablement to support your learning
- Slack channels for SME support, knowledge sharing and networking

Use the following Agenda to guide you through the self paced material.

## Introduction 

The introduction section has been designed to help you understand the key concepts of what building for Cloud Native means. If you have limited knowledge of this area it is highly recommended that you complete this section in full before moving onto using the **IBM GSI Sandbox** enablement for real application development tasks.

## RedHat OpenShift Fundamentals 

GSI teams need consistent execution, proven delivery and assets and support a wide range of use 
cases to enable project teams to accelerate their delivery. The fundamental learning path is understanding how 
to build RedHat OpenShift applications and manage them with DevOps. The IBM Garage for Cloud team has 
created a number of of open source assets that can be used to enable. The learning path will give you a good grounding in 
the core fundamentals of cloud native application development on IBM Cloud with RedHat OpenShift.   

**Desired outcomes:**
- Understand how to approach Cloud Native Development with IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift
- Use Day 1 developer experience to create your first OpenShift app that is managed with a CI Pipeline
- Build a 3 tier microservice application that is fully deployed with Jenkins/CI and Argo/CD
- Understand how Day 2 developer experience is managed with Logging, Monitoring, CD deployment
- Understand how to Secure you applications end to end
- Understand how to do coffee shop development with Code Ready Containers for learning and experimenting  on your local laptop

_Requirements_:
- Some understanding of **Java** and **NodeJS** is required
- Some understanding of **Enterprise** class applications
- Some understanding of **DevOps** pipelines
