Before you proceed, make sure you have an IBM GSI Sandbox invite. It enables you to access an IBM Cloud account with the <a target="_blank" href="https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/overview">Developer Tools environment</a> already installed and ready for you to use, including both a Kubernetes cluster and an OpenShift cluster. (The environment is locked down to prevent creating any new services.) Also, before proceeding:
- Install the <a target="_blank" href="https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/getting-started/cli">IBM Garage for Cloud CLI</a> (again) to ensure you have the latest version

This learning journey focuses on Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) and it has been installed with single sign on in the IBM Cloud in the same way a client
  would have it configured for their account. This gives you access to all the software that is included in the
   **CP4I** offering, see the welcome screen below.
