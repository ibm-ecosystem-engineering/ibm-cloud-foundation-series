title: Cloud Native Introduction
---

The foundation of any IBM Cloud solution is a **Cloud Native** application. This core concept is formulated from a flexible platform and open programming models. These programming models enable a wide range of solutions to be constructed and delivered to users on top of an open platform. To enable developers and architects to realise the value of cloud native, IBM Cloud and RedHat have delivered a world class open platform to support enterprise software and **Cloud Native** applications.

This learning journey has been designed to take developers through a step by step journey to build strong skills in both the programming models IBM is aligned towards and the underlying platform. This platform is RedHat OpenShift, the multi/hybrid cloud kubernetes environment that provides developers extreme flexibility in build solutions for clients.

This Learning Journey is targeted at the following  [personas](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_personas/):
- **The Cloud Native Developer**
- **The DevOps Engineer**
- **The Ops and SRE's ([Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering))** 

The enablement is broken into three core areas. The first is to outline the concepts and basic technical fundamentals of **Cloud Native**. The next section focuses on short self paced pre learning that will get you beyond the beginner stage. Finally you are given access to an **IBM Cloud Sandbox** that allows real **Cloud Native** applications to be created and deployed with full *DevOps* and management. Follow the links below to get started.
